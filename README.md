This is Repostry of program for using system's mouse using default Camera of laptop.
I have implemented this code using python and its modules like opencv, pyautogui and mediapipe.
To execute this code, you need python version 3.8
Execute the Main.py py file for activating the mouse.
Move you hand around the screen to move the cursor.
Use index finger for left click and middle finger for right click.
Fold all the fingers and show thums up to scroll and thumbs down for scrolling down.
Additionally I have implemented Volume up and Volume down operation.
Changing volume is similar to thumbs up and down, but you have to do thumbs left and right, instead of up and down.
